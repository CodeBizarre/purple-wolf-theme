### Early release, requesting feedback/contribution. Colors are SUBJECT TO CHANGE!

This project is my second theme, my goal is to provide a slightly more refined experience and reduce some of the brightness in [my previous theme](https://github.com/CodeBizarre/vscode-awoo-theme) ([marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=code-bizarre.awoo-theme)).

I decided not to simply update my previous work, since I have received much posiive feedback on it and instead have created a new theme from the ground up, as I would hate to take away something that others enjoyed. I will also continue to maintain the Awoo theme as required.

That being said, I appreciate any and all constructive feedback, and encourage contribution Though this too is a theme designed first and foremost for myself, I'd like to make it nice for others as well.

## Goals
* Provide a nice middle ground theme that is dark but not excessively so.
* Provide a reasonable amount of contrast without being distracting.
* Provide colors that are bright but don't have the "eye-piercing" effect
  * Colors should complement eachother and not clash
* Work on any and all programming languages at least fairly well
* Focus on VS Code and provide ports with limited support to other editors and formats
